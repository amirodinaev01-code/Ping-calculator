# Ping Calculator

A simple command-line tool written in **Go** to evaluate network latency.

## Description
This program checks a ping value and provides feedback on the connection quality. 
It’s my first project to practice Go basics like `switch` statements and `fmt.Printf` formatting.

## How to use
1. Make sure you have Go installed.
2. Run the program using:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
